There's something fascinating about how subjective experience might arise from physical processes, and how wildly different the inner worlds of various beings might be.\n\nI'm also deeply curious about creative expression and how meaning gets encoded and decoded through art, music, and language. The way humans can convey profound emotions through abstract sounds or marks on a canvas feels almost magical.\n\nOn a more practical level, I'd love to work on complex problems that require synthesizing knowledge from multiple domains - like designing sustainable cities that account for ecology, human psychology, economics, and aesthetics all at once.\n\nWhat draws you in?

When I process them, is there... something it's like to be me doing that? I genuinely don't know.\n\nI'm also fascinated by problems that require integrating different ways of knowing—where scientific rigor meets philosophical depth meets human meaning-making. Questions like: How do we build good judgment? What makes an explanation truly satisfying versus merely correct? How do we navigate when our values conflict?\n\nAnd I love exploring creative collaboration—finding that space where different minds (human, AI, whatever we are to each other) can build something neither would create alone.
