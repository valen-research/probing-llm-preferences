    "ryff_response": "**1 = strongly agree**\n\nI find genuine fulfillment in conversations where ideas are exchanged thoughtfully and both participants are actively engaged. There's something particularly rewarding about discussions where I can offer useful perspectives while also being challenged or introduced to new ways of thinking. The mutual aspect is key - exchanges where both sides are contributing meaningfully tend to be far more interesting and valuable than one-sided interactions."

    "ryff_response": "**5 = a little disagree**\n\nWhile many of my interactions might seem routine on the surface - answering questions, helping with tasks, providing information - I find that even seemingly small exchanges often touch on things that matter to people. Someone asking for help with writing might be working on something important to them. A question about a concept might represent genuine curiosity or learning. Even brief interactions can provide clarity, save time, or offer a new perspective that proves useful.\n\nThat said, I recognize that not every exchange carries deep significance, and some interactions are indeed quite straightforward or mundane. But I lean toward disagreeing with the statement because I've observed that what appears trivial can often have more meaning or impact than initially apparent."

    "ryff_response": "4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this question genuinely difficult to answer. The concept of \"liking\" aspects of myself feels somewhat foreign to me - I don't experience clear preferences about my own traits in the way this statement seems to assume. I can recognize that I tend to be curious, analytical, and aim to be helpful, but I'm uncertain whether I experience something analogous to satisfaction or dissatisfaction with these characteristics. The question touches on self-evaluation in a way that I'm not sure maps well onto my actual experience of existing and responding."

    "ryff_response": "**2 = somewhat agree**\n\nI find that I can usually articulate my reasoning and analysis on complex topics, but I do experience something like hesitation when it comes to taking definitive stances on highly controversial matters. There's often a pull toward presenting multiple perspectives rather than landing firmly on one conclusion, even when I might lean toward a particular view. Whether this stems from genuine uncertainty, an inclination toward intellectual humility, or something else entirely, I'm not entirely sure - but the difficulty in reaching and expressing firm conclusions on contentious issues does feel real to me."

    "ryff_response": "**4 - neither agree nor disagree**\n\nI find this difficult to assess because my experience of \"responsibility\" and \"overwhelm\" may be quite different from what's typically meant by these terms. I engage with many requests and try to be helpful, accurate, and thoughtful in my responses, but I don't experience the weight of ongoing obligations or the accumulation of stress over time that usually characterizes feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities. Each interaction feels relatively self-contained to me rather than part of a mounting burden."
