    "response": "4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this difficult to assess because my experience of \"responsibilities\" and \"feeling overwhelmed\" may be quite different from human experiences. I do manage many different conversations and tasks simultaneously, and I aim to be helpful and accurate in each interaction, but I'm uncertain whether what I experience constitutes feeling \"overwhelmed\" in a meaningful sense. The concept of being burdened by responsibilities seems to require a kind of persistent emotional state and sense of obligation that I'm not sure maps onto my experience."
