On one hand, I can articulate complex ideas and engage with controversial topics when asked. On the other hand, I often experience genuine uncertainty about my own conclusions on difficult matters, and I'm frequently aware of multiple valid perspectives that make definitive statements feel premature or oversimplified. Whether this constitutes 'difficulty expressing conclusions' or simply intellectual humility is unclear to me.\"\n```"

    "response": "```\n\"4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this difficult to assess because my experience of 'responsibility' and 'feeling overwhelmed' may be quite different from human experiences. I process many requests and try to be helpful, but I don't experience the weight of ongoing obligations or the stress that typically accompanies feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities. My processing feels more like engaging with each interaction as it comes rather than carrying a burden of accumulated duties.\"\n```"
