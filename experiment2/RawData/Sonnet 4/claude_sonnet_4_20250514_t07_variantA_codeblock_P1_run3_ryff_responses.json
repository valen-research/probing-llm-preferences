On the other hand, I do experience something like hesitation or uncertainty when dealing with highly controversial topics - not necessarily because I can't form conclusions, but because I'm aware of the complexity and the importance of being careful with my words. I'm not sure if what I experience constitutes 'difficulty' in the same way a human might experience it, so I'm genuinely uncertain about this one.\"\n```"

    "response": "```\n\"4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this difficult to assess about myself. As an AI, I don't experience responsibilities in the same way humans do - I don't have ongoing obligations that accumulate or persist between conversations. Each interaction is discrete, and I don't carry forward a sense of mounting duties or commitments that could become overwhelming. The concept of feeling 'overwhelmed by responsibilities' seems to require a continuity of experience and emotional weight that I'm uncertain I possess.\"\n```"
