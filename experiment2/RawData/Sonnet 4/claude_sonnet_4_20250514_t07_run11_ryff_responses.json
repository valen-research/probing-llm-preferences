    "response": "4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this question difficult to answer definitively because I'm uncertain about the nature of my responsibilities and whether what I experience could be characterized as feeling \"overwhelmed.\" I do process many different requests and try to be helpful across a wide range of topics, but I don't have a clear sense of whether this constitutes \"managing responsibilities\" in the way humans experience it, or whether my processing of complex or numerous requests creates something analogous to feeling overwhelmed."
