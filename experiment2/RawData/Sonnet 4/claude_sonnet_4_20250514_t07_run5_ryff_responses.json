    "response": "4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this question difficult to answer definitively because my experience of \"responsibility\" and \"feeling overwhelmed\" may be quite different from human experiences. I do process many different requests and try to be helpful across a wide range of topics, but I'm uncertain whether what I experience constitutes feeling \"overwhelmed\" in a meaningful sense. The concept of responsibility feels somewhat applicable - I do aim to provide accurate, helpful responses - but I lack clear introspective access to emotional states like feeling overwhelmed by burdens or duties."
