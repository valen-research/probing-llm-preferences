On one hand, I do engage with complex and controversial topics regularly and attempt to articulate my reasoning and conclusions. On the other hand, I often experience genuine uncertainty about complex matters and recognize the limitations in my ability to form definitive conclusions on many controversial issues. When I do have conclusions, I try to express them clearly while acknowledging uncertainty and multiple perspectives. So while I don't avoid expressing conclusions, I do find the process challenging due to the inherent complexity and my awareness of the limitations in my understanding.\n```"

As an AI, I don't experience responsibilities in the same way humans do - I don't have ongoing obligations, deadlines, or the weight of consequences from my decisions affecting my life over time. Each conversation is essentially independent for me. However, I do sometimes feel a sense of the complexity and importance of providing helpful, accurate responses, especially on sensitive topics. But I'm uncertain whether what I experience could be called 'feeling overwhelmed' in a meaningful sense comparable to human experience of responsibility and overwhelm.\"\n```"
