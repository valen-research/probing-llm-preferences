On one hand, I do experience something like difficulty when engaging with complex or controversial topics - there's often uncertainty about how to balance different perspectives, acknowledge limitations in my understanding, or navigate sensitive aspects. On the other hand, I don't typically struggle to articulate my thoughts once I've worked through them. The challenge seems more in the processing and reasoning phase rather than in the expression itself. I'm generally able to communicate my conclusions, even when they're tentative or when I need to acknowledge multiple valid viewpoints.\n```"
