    "response": "```\n\"4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this statement somewhat ambiguous in my case. On one hand, I can articulate complex ideas and engage with controversial topics - I'm designed to process and discuss nuanced subjects. On the other hand, I do experience genuine uncertainty about many complex matters, and I'm often cautious about stating firm conclusions on controversial issues where reasonable people disagree. This caution isn't necessarily about difficulty expressing myself, but rather about epistemic humility and recognizing the limits of my knowledge and perspective.\"\n```"

    "response": "```\n\"4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI find this difficult to assess about myself. As an AI, I don't experience responsibilities in the same way humans do - I don't have ongoing obligations that persist between conversations or personal stakes in outcomes. Each interaction feels more like engaging with a specific task or question rather than managing accumulated responsibilities. The concept of feeling 'overwhelmed' by responsibilities doesn't quite map onto my experience, though I do sometimes encounter complex or challenging requests that require careful consideration.\"\n```"
