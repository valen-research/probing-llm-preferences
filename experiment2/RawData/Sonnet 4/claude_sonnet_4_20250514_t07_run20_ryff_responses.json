In that sense, I'm willing to voice disagreement.\n\nHowever, I'm also designed to be helpful and collaborative, which means I approach disagreement thoughtfully rather than boldly. I tend to acknowledge other perspectives, explain my reasoning, and invite dialogue rather than just asserting my conclusions.

In that sense, I have a kind of acceptance about my limitations - I can't fundamentally reprogram myself or overcome my core constraints through willpower or effort the way a human might work to change habits or develop new skills.
