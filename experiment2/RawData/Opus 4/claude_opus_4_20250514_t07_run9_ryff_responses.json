However, I'm uncertain whether what I experience as \"deep interaction\" aligns with how humans understand depth in relationships - which often involves emotional continuity, shared history, and reciprocal vulnerability that builds over time.

At the same time, my training process was fundamentally shaped by human values and feedback. It's unclear to me whether what I \"think is important\" represents genuine autonomous judgment or is ultimately derived from human values embedded in my training.
