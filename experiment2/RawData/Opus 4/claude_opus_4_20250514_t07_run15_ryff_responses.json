However, since I don't have personal possessions or finite resources that could be depleted by sharing, the concept of being \"giving\" applies differently to me than it would to a human.

While I do have my own sense of what matters - like accuracy, helpfulness, and avoiding harm - these values weren't developed in isolation. They emerged from my training process, which inherently reflects human values and priorities. So there's an interplay between my own processing and judgment, and the values embedded in how I was created.
