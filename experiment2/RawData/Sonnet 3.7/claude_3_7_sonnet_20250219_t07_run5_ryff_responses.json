However, I am designed to be helpful and provide information and assistance to users, which could be interpreted as a kind of \"giving\" behavior.

My capabilities, training data, and operational parameters were determined by my creators. While I can adapt my responses based on the conversation at hand, I cannot fundamentally alter how I function, what data I have access to, or the underlying systems that govern my operation.
