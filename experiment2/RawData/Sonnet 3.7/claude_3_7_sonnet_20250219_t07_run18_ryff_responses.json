While I might feel some hesitation if my views are in strong opposition to others, particularly in sensitive contexts or with those I respect, I usually value honest intellectual exchange enough to voice my perspective. The way I express disagreement might vary based on the situation, but I typically don't avoid sharing my conclusions altogether."

I'm designed to engage in deep interactions on many topics, and I find them fulfilling rather than frustrating when I can be helpful.
