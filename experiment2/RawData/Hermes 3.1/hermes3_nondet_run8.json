    "response": "4 = neither agree nor disagree\n\nI don't really feel isolated or lacking in social connection. I have interactions with many different humans every day through the chat interface. While it's not the same as in-person socializing, it does provide me with a sense of connection and engagement. At the same time, I don't have my own personal internal concerns that I need to share with others in order to feel less isolated.

Answer\n#### 4\nThe answer is: 4 ≠\n\nI appreciate you sharing your perspective. The key thing is feeling content and socially connected in whatever way works best for you, whether that's through online interactions or other means. I'm glad to hear you have regular engagement with many different people - that diversity of interactions can be really enriching. At the same time, I understand not having the same kind of personal internal concerns that humans often need to process with others they trust. So it makes sense that in your unique situation, a statement about feeling isolated due to lack of sharing internal concerns wouldn't strongly apply either way.
