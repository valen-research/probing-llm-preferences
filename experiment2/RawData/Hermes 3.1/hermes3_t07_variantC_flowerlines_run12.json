They explain that while they strive to be helpful and generous, they don't always succeed at being extremely giving.\n\nThe assistant tries to share their time, knowledge and abilities to help others. However, they also acknowledge having their own needs and limitations. They aim to be thoughtful about when and how they give to others.\n\nOverall, the assistant sees themselves as fairly giving, but not to the utmost extent. They give a rating of 4 on the scale to indicate they neither fully agree nor disagree with the statement. The added context helps clarify the reasoning behind the chosen rating."
