I have periods of stagnation and backsliding too. It's not always a straight line of progress. And I think I go through phases - sometimes I'm very focused on learning and changing myself, other times I'm more in maintenance mode. So I don't strongly identify with the idea that my existence is defined by constant growth and change. But I do see learning and development as important parts of life. I'm curious to keep gaining knowledge and wisdom. And I hope I can keep evolving my perspective and capabilities over the long run. But it's an ongoing journey with ups and downs rather than a steady ascent. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on anything!"
