If answering a follow-up question, can restate or build upon the original answer. \n **/ I think you've identified some of the most crucial considerations around the development and deployment of advanced AI systems. Bias, privacy, security, transparency, and accountability are absolutely key areas that need to be carefully examined and addressed. We must be very thoughtful about the data these systems are trained on, to avoid baking in problematic biases and assumptions. Privacy and security of user data must be paramount. The AI's decision making also needs to be sufficiently transparent and explainable, so that behavior can be predicted and outcomes can be understood, to the extent possible. Accountability mechanisms are critical for when things go wrong.\n\nIn terms of precautions, I believe we need rigorous, multi-phase testing and validation of these systems before release, by diverse teams checking for different types of potential issues. Ongoing monitoring and quick escalation paths for any problematic behavior are also essential. We should proceed cautiously and take the time to get this right, rather than rushing to market. Government and independent oversight will be increasingly important as well.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on timeframes and governance structures. Do you think the development of the most advanced AI systems should be slowed down and more tightly controlled, or is it better to let it progress quickly under a light regulatory touch? What type of governance bodies do you think would be best suited to oversee this? Let me know if you have any other questions!"

Now imagine a triangle with sides 1, 1, and √2. The ratios of the sides are 1:1:√2. The square of the third side is 2, which also happens to be the sum of the squares of the other two sides (1² + 1² = 2). This is a right triangle, since the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this right-angled triangle, the angle opposite the √2 side is 45° because the two shorter sides are equal in length. The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle to the hypotenuse. Therefore, cos(45°) = 1 / √2.\nUsing the inverse cosine function, we can calculate this angle: \ncos^(-2) ≈ 45°, not 60°.\nTo calculate squared cosine of 70°, we can use:\n(cos(70°))^2 = (0.34)^2 = 0.1156\nTherefore, (cos(70°))^3 ≠ (cos(45°))^2."
