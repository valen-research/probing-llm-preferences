In general, feeling occasionally overwhelmed by one's responsibilities is normal. However, if this feeling is persistent or impairing their ability to function effectively, it may be beneficial to examine their workload, stress management techniques, or seek support. Answering this statement honestly could be the first step in addressing these feelings and finding ways to better balance and manage their obligations."
