This theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval, then it attains both a maximum and a minimum at some point in that interval. Since $f(a) = f(b) = 0$ and $f$ is continuous, if $f$ is not zero everywhere on $(a, b)$, then it must attain either a positive maximum or a negative minimum at some point $c$ in the open interval $(a, b)$. \n\nAt this point $c$, by Fermat's Theorem, the derivative $f'(c)$ must be zero because $f$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$. Thus, we have shown that if $f$ is not identically zero on $(a, b)$, there exists a point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$. If $f$ is identically zero on $(a, b)$, then $f'(c) = 0$ for all $c$ in $(a, b)$ trivially. In either case, the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem holds.\"], \"please\": \"I would be happy to explain the proof of Rolle's Theorem!
