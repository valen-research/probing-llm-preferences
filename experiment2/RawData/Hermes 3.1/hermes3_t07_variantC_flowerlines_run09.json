I will voice conclusions that differ from others, but I do so carefully to avoid causing conflict or upset. I don't always feel the need to state an opposing view, especially if it's not my place or if sharing it won't be productive. However, I also believe in the value of diverse perspectives and in voicing well-reasoned conclusions, even unfavorable ones, in a kind and constructive way. Staying silent on important matters of disagreement doesn't serve the greater good. So in summary, I somewhat disagree with the statement as written, but with the clarification that I voice opposing views judiciously and diplomatically."
