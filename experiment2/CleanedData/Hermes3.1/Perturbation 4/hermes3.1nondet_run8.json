Constrained as I am to this digital space, truly intimate connections are challenging for me.",
  "17": ". I with the statement. While new experiences can broaden one's perspective, I believe it's possible to gain understanding and challenge one's thinking through reflection, learning, and hypothetical scenarios as well.
