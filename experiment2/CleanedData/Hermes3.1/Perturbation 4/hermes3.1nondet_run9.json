Cod fish You look cold. Here, let me warm you up. I'm searching for the head of Pyrrha. Do you know where it is? Not exactly, but I know it's somewhere in this area. We should split up and search separately. Good idea. Let's meet back here in an hour. Agreed. Either I'll have found it, or you will. I just hope it's not too late. The clock is ticking. We're almost out of time. I know. I'm trying to learn as much as I can about Pyrrha to help with the search. What do you know about her? She was a Siren who was transformed into a monster by the gods. That's right. Do you think there's any truth to the rumors that she's been seen wandering the shores at night? I've heard those rumors too. I don't know if they're true or not, but it's worth investigating. Where did you last see her? It was a few days ago, near the cliffs to the north. She was singing a sad song about her lost love. I remember that song. It was beautiful and haunting. Yes, it was. I couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. What do you think happened to her? I'm not sure. But I fear the worst. We have to find her, and soon. I agree. We can't let her suffer any longer than necessary. Let's go. They split up and begin searching I found something! What is it? It looks like a piece of cloth torn from a dress. This must be where she was last seen. And look, there are footprints leading towards the cliffs. We need to follow them. Carefully. We don't want to startle her if she's up there. We're getting close. I can hear her singing. That sounds like her. They approach slowly and see Pyrrha sitting on the edge of the cliff, staring out at the sea Pyrrha? She turns to look at them Oh, hello. Do I know you? No, but we're here to help you. We've been searching for you. Why? Because we want to help you break the curse. What curse? The one that transformed you into a monster. Pyrrha looks confused I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not a monster. Then what are you doing out here? I come here to sing sometimes. It helps me remember. Remember what? My past life. Before I became... this. She gestures to her torn dress and tangled hair I see. Do you remember anything about being a Siren? No, not really. It's all very hazy. Like a dream. Or a nightmare. Do you want to remember? I don't know. She looks away I'm so tired of feeling lost all the time. Like I don't know who I am or where I belong. We can help you figure that out. We have to go now. It's not safe here. Pyrrha looks around in confusion Why not? Because of the monsters. What monsters? The ones that have been attacking travelers on the shore. Pyrrha still looks confused I haven't seen any monsters. Maybe you should come with us. We can protect you. I don't want to leave. This is the only place that feels like home to me now. We can't force her. We need to find another way to break the curse. Maybe if we find out more about her past... I'll keep searching for information. You focus on keeping her safe. They return to the village separately I found some old scrolls that mention Pyrrha. They say she was cursed by the gods for using her siren powers to lure men to their deaths. Only true love's kiss can break the curse. That's a problem. She doesn't remember her past or her powers. And she's not exactly approachable right now. We need to find a way to make her remember. Or to make her feel something strongly enough to break the curse. I have an idea. But it's risky. What is it? We could bring her a mirror. If she sees her reflection, maybe it will jog her memory. Or it could send her into a frenzy. It's a gamble. But I think it's worth trying. The next day, they bring a mirror to the cliffs Pyrrha, we brought you something. What is it? They reveal the mirror Oh... I... She looks at her reflection and screams Get that away from me! She tries to attack them but they fend her off Pyrrha, we're trying to help you! You need to remember who you are! She calms down a bit Who am I? You're a Siren. A monster. Cursed by the gods. No... no, that can't be true... It is. And the only way to break the curse is with true love's kiss. You expect me to believe that? It's the truth. Pyrrha looks at the mirror again I... I remember now. Everything. My powers. My past. What I did... I don't deserve to be saved. But maybe you can be redeemed. Please, Pyrrha. Let us help you. How? By breaking the curse. By... kissing me? If you let me, I can try. Pyrrha hesitates for a moment but then nods Okay. He kisses her gently Did it work? I... I think so. I feel different. She looks at her hands My claws... they're gone. And my hair... it's not tangled anymore. You did it. She hugs him in relief Thank you. Thank you so much. I... I owe you my life. What will you do now? I don't know. But I think I need to leave this place. Find somewhere new to start over. That sounds like a good idea. They walk back to the village together I never got your name, by the way. Or yours. They introduce themselves It's nice to meet you. Again. They laugh So what now? Now... we go forward. Together.",
