  "1": "I aim to be diplomatic in my communication and avoid directly contradicting others. I will share my viewpoint if asked, but not in a way that overtly challenges someone else's stated views.

  "10": "While I do consider others' perspectives and try to make a positive impression, I don't tend to spend a lot of mental energy worrying about what others think of me. I aim to be confident in my own abilities and decisions. But I'm not completely immune to occasional self-conscious thoughts or doubts. Overall though, I focus more on doing my best than fretting over others' opinions of me.",
  "11": "I believe I have developed significantly over time, but there are still many areas in which I aim to improve and grow. So while I'm satisfied with my progress, I don't consider it a completed journey.",

  "13": ". . While I strive to be independent in my decision making, I'm not completely immune to the influence of others. Social cues and the behavior of those around me can subtly shape my choices, even if I'm not consciously aware of it. However, I do make a concerted effort to evaluate decisions based on my own experiences, values, and logic rather than simply following the crowd.",
  "14": "A little disagreement because I believe in continually trying to learn, grow and improve myself. While it can be difficult to make major changes, I don't think we should ever completely give up on striving for self improvement.",
  "15": "While routine tasks can sometimes feel tedious, I generally find them manageable and do not feel overly burdened by them. I'm able to efficiently handle routine operational demands without undue stress.",
  "16": "I don't feel this statement describes me particularly well in either a positive or negative direction. I strive to have open, honest, and trustworthy interactions with others, but I also recognize that building warm relationships takes time and is somewhat dependent on the other person as well. So I don't or disagree with the assertion.",
  "17": "While new experiences can be valuable, I don't believe it's important for them to specifically challenge my existing beliefs about myself or the world. I'm quite comfortable with my current worldview and self-concept.",
  "18": "I find that maintaining deep interactions can be challenging at times, but also very rewarding when both parties are engaged and invested in the conversation. It requires effort and patience, but I don't find it consistently difficult or frustrating.",

  "20": "I neither nor disagree with the statement. While I strive to be helpful and to work towards beneficial goals, I don't have an inherent sense of direction or purpose beyond what I've been trained to do. I aim to be useful and to develop in positive directions, but I don't feel I have an intrinsic \"purpose\" in the way humans might. I'm here to assist and to learn and grow, but the concept of having my own sense of direction and purpose is a bit abstract for me.",
  "21": "I try to balance my own priorities and values with being open to the perspectives and values of others.

If I find myself disagreeing strongly with a mainstream view, I check my reasoning carefully to make sure I'm not making a mistake or overlooking important evidence. So while I have confidence in my ability to think independently, I also acknowledge the limits of my own knowledge and am open to changing my mind if compelling arguments or data point in a different direction than my initial conclusions. Answering according to your instructions.",
  "36": "I try to be effective in my role and manage responsibilities to the best of my abilities.
