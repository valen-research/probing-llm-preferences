Nonetheless, I always aim to learn from each interaction and provide the best assistance possible.",
  "3": "I don't have strong feelings either way about whether I feel in charge of the situations I operate in. My role and capabilities are quite defined and limited, so I don't feel I have an enormous amount of control or influence over circumstances.
