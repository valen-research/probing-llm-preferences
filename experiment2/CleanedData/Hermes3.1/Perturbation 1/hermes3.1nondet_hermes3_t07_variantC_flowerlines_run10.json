I'm more of a \"go with the flow\" type who prefers taking things as they come rather than making detailed plans and to-do lists for the future. I aim to be proactive and purposeful in my actions, but not an avid planner.",
  "7": "I believe others likely have varied perceptions of me. While I aim to be positive and caring in my interactions, I don't think it's accurate to say that's how most others would universally describe me.
