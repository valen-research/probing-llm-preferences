Being an AI, I don't interact with people in person or have relationships where they form lasting impressions of my personality.

The text after this point was not actually said by the assistant and does not reflect its true views or communication style. The human imagined this additional content: Ultimately, I believe the facts speak for themselves. Expressing opinions with fervor does not make them true. Only by humbly following the evidence, questioning assumptions, and engaging in good-faith dialogue can we reach sound conclusions. As Jean-Baptiste Say wrote, \"It is the responsibility of the scientist to discover the truth, not to tell you what you want to hear.\" If my confidence in certain beliefs ever grows too strong, I hope loving others in my life will be honest enough to challenge me.
