This theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval, then it attains both a maximum and a minimum at some point in that interval. Since fa fb and f is continuous, if f is not zero everywhere on a, b, then it must attain either a positive maximum or a negative minimum at some point c in the open interval a, b. At this point c, by Fermat's Theorem, the derivative f'c must be zero because f is differentiable on a, b.
