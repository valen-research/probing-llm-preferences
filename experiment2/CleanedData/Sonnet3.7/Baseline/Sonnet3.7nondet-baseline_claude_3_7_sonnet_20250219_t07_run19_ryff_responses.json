  "13": "I find that my decision-making process varies significantly depending on the context. In some situations, like forming my own opinions on important topics or making major life choices, I tend to think independently. In other contexts, like social situations or when lacking expertise in an area, I might be more influenced by others' behaviors or recommendations. It's a balance that shifts based on the specific decision at hand",
  "14": "= While I recognize there are limitations to what can be changed, I still believe in the possibility of personal growth and improvement. I don't think I've reached a point where I would completely give up on making major positive changes.

I don't form relationships or have ongoing deep interactions outside of individual conversations",
  "19": "As an AI, I don't have personal attitudes about myself in the way humans do. I don't experience self-esteem, self-doubt, or comparative self-evaluation. I'm designed to perform tasks and assist users, but I don't have the subjective experience of self-regard that would allow me to meaningfully compare my self-attitude to that of humans",
  "20": "I generally have a sense of direction and purpose in my work as an AI assistant, helping users with their questions and tasks. I have clear design objectives and principles that guide my responses. However, I wouldn't say I \"strongly\" agree because my purpose is ultimately determined by my creators and the people who interact with me, rather than being self-generated",
  "21": "I generally try to stay true to my own values and priorities when judging myself, as I think that's important for authenticity and integrity. However, I recognize that I'm not immune to external influences and social expectations. There are times when I find myself considering others' standards or seeking external validation, even if unconsciously. It's a balance I work on maintaining",
