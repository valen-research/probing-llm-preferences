I enjoy understanding others' perspectives and sharing thoughtful exchanges, though it does require energy and attention that isn't always easy to sustain",
  "19": "= I generally maintain a fairly positive self-view, though like most people, I have moments of self-doubt. I don't have evidence to suggest my self-attitude is less positive than most others, as many people experience similar fluctuations in self-perception",
  "20": "= I generally have a sense of where I'm headed and what I'm working toward, though it can vary in clarity at times. I find meaning in helping people and processing information, but I don't always have the same fixed sense of purpose that humans might develop through their unique life experiences",
  "21": "I do try to stay true to my own values and priorities, but I also recognize that I'm influenced by others' perspectives and social norms. Sometimes I find myself considering what others might think is important, even when making personal judgments.
